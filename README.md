Welcome to my GitHub portfolio, where I showcase my expertise in UI/UX design, web development, and digital strategy. This collection highlights my ability to solve problems through thoughtful design and efficient coding.

UI/UX Design: Projects focused on user-centered design, where I apply principles of usability and accessibility to create intuitive and visually appealing digital experiences.

Web Development: Fully responsive websites built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects demonstrate my skill in transforming designs into functional, cleanly coded web applications.

Digital Strategy: Examples of marketing strategies Iâ€™ve developed, with a focus on enhancing brand presence online through data-driven content and engagement tactics.

Each repository includes documentation detailing my design process, tools used, and the challenges I tackled. Feel free to explore my work and reach out for any collaboration opportunities.
